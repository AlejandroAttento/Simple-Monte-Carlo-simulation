    "Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows us to estimate for a geometric figure the area or the volume in case that the analytical calculation is too complex, or if the time a computer needs to perform this calculation is too long. We will see that using this methode we can estimate probabilities."

    "Given any 2D or 3D geometric figure with some complex shape we will estimate the area or volume. To get this value we will enclose this first figure into a second figure (This figure has to been simple and we have to know the value of the area or volume). After that, we will choose a lot of points from this second figure randomly, the amount depends on each case and the accuracy we want to get back. If we analyze each one of this points and classify then into \"points which belongs to both figures\" or \"points which belongs only to the second figure\" we can get the percentage of points which belongs to both figures and the percentage of points which belongs only to the second figure, if we multiply this value to the area (or volume) of the second figure (we already know) we will get an estimation of the area (or volume) for each figure."

If we choose any point this one could belongs only to the second figure or to both, if we choose 1000 points the same happens, and if we think a littel about that we are speacking about a probability, the probability that any randomly choosen point belongs only to the second figure or to both. And this probability has a relation to the area of each figure. Also, we know that the mathematical formula to calculate the area of a circle use the pi value, if we could get the relation between the probability and the pi value we could estimate pi."
